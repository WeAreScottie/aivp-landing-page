Founded in 2007, the Association of Independent Venue Producers (AIVP)'s members account for 85% of tickets sold across the Edinburgh Fringe. 


Its founding reflects the growth in activity and risk by venue producers in the last two decades. Although venue producers largely operate without any public subsidy, they are a key force behind the Fringe. 


AIVPâ€™s main purpose is to act as a central forum for discussion and decision on key issues, which members have in common and act as a lobbying voice with funders and stakeholders of the wider Edinburgh Festival Fringe. 


Venue Producers develop new venues and nurture new talent. Their actions affect all involved - from performers to the festival-going public. Pressure to maintain and develop facilities has never been higher and so it is vitally important that Venue Producers support each other to achieve common goals, creating a sustainable and supportive environment for all who are a part of our sector.


Venue producing organisations of any size are welcomed to become AIVP members, so long as they are independently produced. Members have the opportunity to network formerly and informally with other venue producers and have the ability to contribute to and shape the priorities of AIVP. 


Our core goal is to share experience, information, and ideas in order to achieve the best opportunities and outcomes for everyone engaging with Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
